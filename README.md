## Bag Filters

This addon adds the ability to set a filter for each bag container.

### Description

To set a filter, click on the portrait of the desired bag and a dropdown menu will appear. The menu contains all available filters. Simply click on one of the menu items and a filter will be set.

Setting a filter for a bag will sort the items of that bag according to the applied filter. This is useful if you want to break up your inventory into different sections. For example, your backpack can be set to hold quest items, your first bag to hold weapons and so on. Filtered bags can also hold other items, but items that fit the set filter have priority over other items.

### Filters

The currently available filters are based on the available item types in the game. More filters are planned.

Items are filtered when:

* A corpse is looted
* A trade is completed/canceled
* The merchant frame is closed
* A filter is set

The interval between moving two items in a bag is set to 1 second. It is possible to lower this number and thus make the sorting faster, but this can lead to some items being locked and usable only after relogging. The only way to prevent this is to have a higher interval value.
